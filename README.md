# pet_shop
Pete Scandlon of Pete's Pet Shop is interested in using Ethereum as an efficient way to handle their pet adoptions. The store has space for 16 pets at a given time, and they already have a database of pets. As an initial proof of concept, Pete wants to see a dapp which associates an Ethereum address with a pet to be adopted.  The website structure and styling will be supplied. Our job is to write the smart contract and front-end logic for its usage.
